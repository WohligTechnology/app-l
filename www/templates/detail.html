              <p>Sophia sat on the floor of her laundry room, looking at the lipstick mark on Peter’s shirt. She brought it up to her face to smell it. The way their smells mingled made her head dizzy. It was no secret there was another woman. He’d not cheated. Soon as he was sure, he had confessed. Of course there was shouting, crying, going silent and all those things, but she’d agreed, on one single thread. The way Peter had told her that he still loved her as much as before and how she could see in his eyes that he meant it, down to his bones and the core of his heart. It was so strong she couldn’t let go. And after all this time, now she just felt broken but strangely without any pain.

And nothing had truly changed. She couldn’t figure when they met as Peter’s working hours and business trips were still the same. His care, love, affection, concern, all was still the same. If it wasn’t for the confession, she would've never known. May be it would've been better that way?
“What’s the matter” Peter asked Sophia that evening.
She was holding up well until the sheer concern in his voice broke her.
“I saw this lipstick mark on your shirt…”
Peter hugged her. “I’m so sorry.”
